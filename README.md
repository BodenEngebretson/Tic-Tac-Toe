Tic Tac Toe Game

Overview

This is a simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Python. Two players take turns placing their marks (X and O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. The game ends in a draw if all nine cells are filled without a winner.



Features

Two-player mode: Play against a friend by taking turns on the same device.

Interactive grid: The game board updates after each move, showing the current state of play.

Input validation: Ensures that players choose valid moves, preventing overwriting previous moves or selecting out-of-bound positions.

Win detection: Automatically checks and announces the winner or a draw after each move.
